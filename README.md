# I lost you

## This project has now been abandoned. 
### Multiple surveys were conducted to find whether people wanted this.
### Majority didn't want this to be built.

AI can help people grieving from the loss of someone special.
This repository is where the code for a future app will be hosted.

We lost many amazing people due to Covid-19.
It also left many more grieving from the pain of loosing their loved ones.
I wish to help atleast a few for whom this might be life changing.

You give it the chat you did with the person you lost on Whatsapp, and then talk to them.

The application will initially be hosted through Streamlit with the option to upload txt files for chats.
The python application trains the model and then the chat window will help you chat with the person lost.

I sincerely hope this helps people around the world deal with the pain of loosing someone close.
